If systems are used temporarily in production, check for adverse affects on any users who used both systems. Lesson from Wednesday/Thursday following issues for a small number of users.</li> <li>Ensure errors due to trivial issues, like changes to logs or failed schema in the DB, do not cause the whole app to go down. Lesson from Monday and Friday.</li> <li>Ensure adequate logging systems are in place (these have been improved already), and that a clear process is in place for users to contact the team (use lambdafeedback@imperial.ac.uk, or support@lambdafeedback.com which will redirect there)</li> <li>Ensure important messages to users can be seen, e.g. even if they can't log in.   Keep teachers informed promptly and with transparent info. Generally this protocol was followed during this incident.</li> </ul> <p>Conclusion:</p> <ul> <li>The new login system offers significant benefits, including allowing logins with a range of systems such as Google or personally created accounts. The app is now available to essentially any users.</li> <li>The deployment involved errors which caused access issues for over an hour on more than one occasion in the same week.</li> <li>Most of the outages were preventable with improved testing</li> <li>The mitigation attempts were successful in reducing the severity of the incident</li> <li>Mitigation could have been better.

These consist of the following:</li> <li>Matrix</li> <li>Number</li> <li>Boolean (True/false)</li> <li>Text (Suitable for short text answers)</li> <li>Table</li> <li>Multiple-choice</li> <li>Expression (Gives a preview for the typed symbolic expression)</li> <li>Numeric units (Two fields, allowing for units to be assessed)</li> <li>Code</li> <li>Essay (Suitable for long text answers)</li> <li>Each field has suitable evaluation functions. For example, a simple numerical answer is best suited to number, as this supports isSimilar, while assessing an equation is best suited to the expression foeld, as this supports compareExpressions.</li> <li>Each input field may be configured with a series of options:</li> <li>Enable live preview. Default TRUE for the EXPRESSION input type, to validate student input before submitting for feedback.</li> <li>Display input symbols. Default FALSE. When TRUE, the symbols and associated shortcut codes that may be required for a problem are displayed beneath the input field. These are configured in the 'Evaluate' tab. </li> <li>Include in PDF. Default FALSE except for MCQ. Only affects the PDF version. Includes pre/post response text in the PDF, with a blank space between.</li> <li>Pre/post response text (optional). To clarify to students what to input in the response area. Accepts plain text, including single-dollar-delimited latex. E.g. <code>Estimate $f(x)=$</code> is acceptable. When using fractions in this field, use <code>$\\dfrac{}{}$</code> as this is more legible.</li> <li>Answer. Enter a reference answer. This will typically be the absolute solution to a problem. When requesting a symbolic answer, it must be given in terms of the chosen symbol shortcuts.  Configure the answer where relevant (e.g. number of rows and columns).</li> <li>Response Area Preview: for teachers to verify the configuration</li> <li> <p>EVALUATE: configure how student expressions are evaluated. This is a 'no code' parametric configuration. Settings will be upgraded as the system improves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Evaluation Function - select an evaluation function from the list. For example:</p> <ul> <li>isSimilar will perform a basic numerical comparison between the reference answer and         student input, with a configurable level of absolute and relative uncertainty.</li> <li>compareExpressions is typically used where a symbolic answer is requested.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Parameters - configure as provided, and add new parameters as required. Details depend on the Evaluation Function.</li> <li> <p>Input symbols - define a dictionary of symbols and their equivalent in code form. This essentially associates a LaTeX-rendered symbol with a machine-readable variable label, with the LaTeX render returned to the student through the preview. These symbols may also be hiddent to students. All inputs are plain text. For example, the symbol <code>$f(x)$</code> may have code <code>fx</code> and alternatives <code>f_x</code>, <code>f(x)</code>, <code>f</code>. This dictionary will be provided to the evaluation function, even if the teacher has not displayed it to the student. This allow teachers to accept several alternative symbols, such as those with different cases or conventional expressions. The configuration of input symbols is a very important part of providing high quality feedback. Note that the 'visibility' Boolean applies if input symbols are displayed to students, otherwise it is irrelevant. It allows Teachers to communicate some symbols to students, while keeping others hidden to the student but visible to the evaluation function.</p> </li> <li> <p>FEEDBACK: add 'cases'. Each case is an alternative reference answer, with customised parameters, so that multiple cases can be dealt with independently. Cases can be used to capture multiple correct approaches that are not equivalent. Cases can also be used to identify common incorrect approaches and to provide customised feedback. The FEEDBACK tab is typically populated after students start using the system, and when data is available to point to common expressions. Configuring a case works similarly to setting up the default answer in the INPUT tab, with added options for changing the colour of the given feedback, give custom feedback and toggling whether the case answer should be considered correct or not. Adding custom feedback will overwrite the feedback produced by the evaluation function. When a response is submitted, it is evaluated for all cases and feedback for the first case that matches will be displayed. When determining which matched case is first, the default answer described in the INPUT tab will take precedence over all other cases, otherwise the feedback for the matched case with the lowest number will be displayed (i.e. the answer given in the INPUT tab can be considered to be Case 0).  Feedback fields also support LaTeX equations in both <code>$f(x)$</code> and <code>$$f(x)$$</code> formats, and Markdown inputs such as line breaks. Make sure to follow good typesetting practice in this field.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>TESTS: tests provide a systematic way to log what behaviour the teacher expects.
