# Evaluation Functions 

Evaluation functions are responsible for taking in a user's response, comparing it with a correct answer, and providing feedback to the frontend application. Living as containerized Lambda functions on the cloud, they are infinitely customisable and language-agnostic. Content authors should be able to create their own at will. However, we are aware that in a lot of cases, this grading logic will be similar, which is why a few functions have already been created.
