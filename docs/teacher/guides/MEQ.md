# Module Evaluation Questionnaires (MEQ)

## Information for teachers

Students can provide feedback to teachers to recognise good practice and help improve teaching.

General information about MEQs is available on the relevant [student page on MEQ](../../../student/MEQ).

This page provides additional information relevant to teachers.

### Create an MEQ

An MEQ is a special type of Set. It can be created in the _Content_ tab of a module in TEACHER mode. MEQs use templates that are controlled centrally on the tenant (e.g. school or university). To modify or extend the available templates, speak to your administrator.

When you add an MEQ from a template, the following can be edited:

- Name of the MEQ
- Visibility (Opening and closing dates; and 'manually hidden' toggle) 
- Which teachers from the module are evaluated (if any)

Once an MEQ has been created, it becomes a separate copy; future changes to the central templates will not appear in the MEQ you have created. The only options to edit the MEQ are the above listed properties. 

There is no limit to the number of MEQs that can be created in a module.

### Teacher-specific questions

The template question includes general content and response areas that are tailored to the questionnaire environment. One option for each response area is to designate a question as 

_'Repeat statements for each teacher'_

For questions with this toggle, the question repeats identically for each teacher listed in the MEQ settings. The default setting is no teachers, and the teachers need to be manually added in the settings by selecting from teachers who are enrolled on the module.

### Data visibility

An [overview of data visibility](../../../student/MEQ#access-to-meq-data) is provided on the student page on MEQ. The moderator(s) for each module are set by the Administrators, and are visible on the _Teachers_ tab in the module in TEACHER mode.
