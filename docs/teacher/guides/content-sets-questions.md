   | 6     | Question Help Options       | Here we may add a [Structured Tutorial](https://lambda-feedback.github.io/user-documentation/terminology#structured-tutorial), a [Final Answer](https://lambda-feedback.github.io/user-documentation/terminology#final-answer) ("Show Answer"), or [Worked Solutions](https://lambda-feedback.github.io/user-documentation/terminology#worked-solution). These buttons are also how the student will see them, hence the name of "Show Answer".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
   | 7     | Teacher-Student View Toggle | Here we may toggle between the teacher view ("EDIT"), and the student view ("PREVIEW").
