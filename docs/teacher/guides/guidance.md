Guidance is provided at the question level, and can be set to each question in the set.

To edit the question guidance, click the "Edit Guidance" button at the top of the page.

Here you can enter four parts:

2. Minimum Time Estimate - The least amount of time the task should take in minutes.
3. Maximum Time Estimate - The longest amount of time the task should take in minutes.
4. Skill - The difficulty of the task, rated out of three stars. 

### Obtaining Guidance Time

We also support suggesting the time estimate. This uses machine learning based on worked solution and skill level to determine an estimated time for the task.

To use this feature do the following:
1. Fill in all the question's attributes as much as possible. i.e, the question's text, the worked solution, skill level etc., The more information is filled in, the more accurate the suggested guidance time will be.
   
2. Click on the "Suggest" button in the guidance configuration tab after you have filled in all the question's attributes.
