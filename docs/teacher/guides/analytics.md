# Analytics Guide

## Module-level analytics

The module overview tab displays cohort progress and cohort activity. Access to the overview tab is subject to teacher role privileges.

The Content tab displays all Sets, with cohort-level data on activity and progress within each Set. Access to the data within the Content tab is subject to teacher role privileges.

Within the content there is a stats tab which shows cohort-level data on question completion and statistics on time spent on each question. Response Areas are listed and show completion rates overall, and best per student. Detailed response statistics are available in the 'Explore' button on the Response area. The stats tab availability is subject to teacher role privileges.

The ID of Response Areas is linked between module instances. If a Response Area maintains the response data shape then the data across multiple instances can be combined for stronger statistics. As of 10/7/25 there are no features in the UI to link data across instances, but these links will be added in future (the data saved is in the correct structure to allow this feature on all past data).

## Analytics and question versions

Analytics begin when a question is _published_. After publishing a question for the first time it becomes available to students and their usage is logged and fed back to the student and the teacher. 

Each question can have add or remove response areas. When a response area is removed, then it is removed only from the "current version" of the question (the version that the teacher is editing) and it persists on the previous version(s) of the question. This means that all submissions and analytics remain, but they are now linked to the response area which only exists on a previous version(s) of the question.

Currently (as of 10/7/25) only analytics against the published version of the question can be seen in the UI. Other data, although still saved, cannot be seen.
