# Analytics Guide

Analytics begin when a question is _published_. After publishing a question for the first time it becomes available to students and their usage is logged and fed back to the student and the teacher. 

## Analytics History

Analytics are linked to response areas. Each question can have more response areas and they can be added or removed. When a response area is removed, then it is removed only from the "current version" of the question (the version that the teacher is editing) and it persists on the previous version(s) of the question. It means that all submissions and analytics remain, but they are now linked to the response area which only exists on a previous version(s) of the question.

Currently it is possible to see only analytics against the published version of the question.

We are now working on the improvement so that it is possible to see analytics against all reponse areas (including those that exist only on previous versions of the question).

## Tracking students' response
To improve the feedback that students receive and to better understand which areas they need help with, it is possible to check the different student responses and the frequency of each response for each response area. 

To see these statistics:

1. Click on the **Stats** tab in teacher mode.
2. Then click on **Explore** in the top right corner of each response area.

You can even export these statistics as csv file!
