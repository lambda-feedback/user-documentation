### Answering questions
You can make progress on the problem by entering correct answers or clicking the **'Mark as done'** button on the bottom right of each question page. This can be useful to track progress if working on the PDF version, or for questions which do not have a response box, e.g., show that questions.

See the [Answering Questions](answering_questions.md) page for more help with answering questions.
