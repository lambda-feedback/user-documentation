# Module Evaluation Questionnaires (MEQ)

## Information for students

Students can provide feedback to teachers to recognise good practice and help improve teaching.

Each module can contain one or more Module Evaluation Questionnaire (MEQ), which appears in the content as a separate type of Set. When accessed, the MEQ is seen in the context of all open MEQs at the time (across all modules). 

Student responses are treated as follows:

- Responses are saved when 'SUBMIT' is pressed, with confirmation provided.
- Multiple responses are possible. Responses are initialised by the last saved submission, and can then be edited and re-submitted with the 'SUBMIT' button.
- Only the last response is used when collecting data.
- All responses are confidential to all users of the platform, i.e. the author of the response is never associated with the response.
- No responses are visible to teachers while an MEQ is open.


### Access to MEQ data

MEQ data are only accessible to teachers, and only under certain conditions. A minimum of 5 responses are required, after which data is accessible to teachers depending on question type and user role. Note that the 'moderator' is assigned per-module by central admin, and it is typically the director of studies. Data availability is as follows: 

#### Numerical data (Likert scale):

|MEQ is open | Response is about a specific teacher? | Available to |
|--|--|--|
|Yes |n/a|Data not available|
|No |No|Any teacher on the module|
|No |Yes|Only that teacher and the moderator|
  

#### Text data (comments):

|MEQ is open | Response is about a specific teacher? | Moderator approved? |Available to |
|--|--|--|--|
|Yes |n/a| n/a |Moderator (only)|
|No |No| No |Moderator (only)|
|No |No| Yes |Any teacher on the module|
|No |Yes| No |Moderator (only)|
|No |Yes| Yes |Only that teacher and the moderator|

### Progress bar 

When a student has open MEQs that are incomplete, a progress bar will appear on the home page. When all MEQs are complete, or none is open, the bar will disappear.
