- _Structured tutorial_ - teachers use this in different ways. It is generally a way to provide scaffolding if you're struggling.
- _Final Answer_ - warning, don't ever look at the answer before you make your own genuine attempt at answering the question.
- _Worked solutions_ - warning, don't ever look at the solutions before you make your own attempt. If necessary, look at the first line and reveal a step at a time.
