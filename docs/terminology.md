## General Information

LambdaFeedback is a place to study online. Teachers curate content that students can access. Content is available in the browser and in PDF. Automated feedback on final answers and detailed worked solutions are provided.

## Terminology Used and Definitions

Here, the fundamental structure and terminology will be laid out.

### Evaluation Functions

An evaluation function is an algorithm that is applied to a response area, whereby the student's response is evaluated and checked. The types of evaluation functions correspond to the types of response areas.

### Final Answer

This section lies within the "Help" panel which appears upon clicking on the "Help" button. It serves as a simple container for the final answer, so that the student may compare results.

This is an optional section, and so does not have to be included in any question.

### Modules

A module is a set programme of taught material. In a university setting, this would correspond to a course module.

### Questions

A question is a problem within a set, and it may contain any number of parts.

### Response Areas

A response area is an interactive element. Student enters a response and receives feedback. There are different types of response area (text, numerical, array etc.), and these correspond to the different types of information the student is required to input.

### Sets

We use the word 'Set' to refer to a group of questions content. In a university setting, a Set typically corresponds to an individual homework/tutorial sheet.

### Structured Tutorial

Content providing a structure with which to approach a problem - but not to give the full details away. It is encouraged to be the first piece of guidance for the student before they look at the "Worked Solution", or "Final Answer".

This section lies within the "Help" panel which appears upon clicking on the "Help" button.

This is an optional section, and so does not have to be included in any question.

### Student (learner)

From the perspective of Lambda Feedback, a student is someone who accesses and responds to problem sets. A student only has permissions to view and respond to problem sets (not to edit them).

### Teacher

From the perspective of Lambda Feedback, a teacher is someone who creates and manages content. A teacher's account has permissions to create, edit, and delete content within a Module.

### Worked Solution

The stages of working that lead to a final answer. It may be split into multiple steps which the student can reveal sequentially. This section lies within the "Help" panel which appears upon clicking on the "Help" button.

This is an optional section, and so does not have to be included in any question.

### Workspace

On the Question page, the students has access to their own workspace tab. Here they can find the "Canvas", for handwriting notes, and the "Chat", for conversing with an AI Chatbot on the question materials.
