# Opportunities

We are looking for schools, universities, and tutoring agencies to pilot Lambda Feedback. Please register your interest at [https://forms.office.com/e/qA1UndSHrs](https://forms.office.com/e/qA1UndSHrs)

About the pilot:

- Organisations can use the platform (without charge) to deliver self-study exercises to their students.

- All the features of the platform will be available, including curating content, automated feedback, and data analytics

- The team at Imperial will support your deployment

- We will ask for your feedback and suggestions before, during, and after the pilot

- We will initiate further collaborations after the pilot

Key points to consider:

- The [government has advised schools](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1kvyj7dkp0o) to use automation for low stakes feedback

- Lambda Feedback is automated formative feedback, perfect for this application

- We are a not-for-profit project funded by the Imperial College London Digital Innovation Fund (DiF)

- All automated feedback is provided by external services that are open source, tested, and can be used on other platforms

- This is a genuine pilot, and the future of this project will change based on feedback from pioneers who deploy it in practice

- As this is a pilot, it will require engaged participants who are willing to be adaptive and constructively react to challenges.
