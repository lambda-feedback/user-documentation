# AI Chatbots - More information

Chatbot agents are AI Assistants that students can chat with to ask for help or further explanations regarding the Question that they are working on. Each Agent has its own personality and approach to assisting the students.

The Chatbots have at their basis a [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) which received information regarding:

- the details of the Question the student is on currently,
- the final answer, structured tutorial, and worked solutions of the Question,
- the answer for each Response Area,
- the student's progress on all parts of the Question,
- the students's current previewed part,
- the guidance time and tips form the lecturer.
