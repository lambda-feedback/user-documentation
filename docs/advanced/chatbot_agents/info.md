# AI Chatbots - More information

Chatbot agents are AI Assistants that students can chat with to ask for help or further explanations regarding the Question that they are working on. Each Agent has its own personality and approach to assisting the students.

The Chatbots have at their basis a [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) which received information regarding:

- the details of the Question the student is on currently,
- the answer and worked solutions for each Response Area of the Question,
- the student's progress on all parts of the Question,
- the students's current previewed part,
- the guidance time and tips form the lecturer.
