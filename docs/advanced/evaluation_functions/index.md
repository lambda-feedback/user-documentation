# Deployed Evaluation Functions

Documentation for each of the functions registered to the LambdaFeedback platform are pulled in this section automatically. This is done using a custom MkDocs plugin [EvalDocsLoader](https://github.com/lambda-feedback/EvalDocsLoader).

If you can't see any documentation files as subsections here, please contact an admin.
