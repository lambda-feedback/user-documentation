#### 2025a: Formative feedback on engineering self-study: Towards 1 million times per year per cohort

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/Johnson_etal_2025_EDUCON_camera_ready.pdf) or access via IEEE: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11016422](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11016422)

- Conference paper; 3-page summary of the Lambda Feedback system. Recommended for a general overview.

#### 2025b: How do we define and evaluate "good" automated formative feedback?

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/Johnson_etal_SEFI_2025_FeedbackWorkshop.pdf). Will be a workshop at [SEFI 2025](https://www.sefi2025.eu/), but not currently published.

- Conference workshop. General overview (5 pages) of the literature and thinking behind automated formative feedback. Good for educators wanting a general framing of our approach.

#### 2024: Automated Feedback on Student Attempts to Produce a Set of Dimensionless Power Products from a Set of Physical Quantities that Describe a Physical Problem

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/Lundengard_etal_2023_Preprint_Automated_feedback_on_dimensionless_power_products_from_physical_quantities.pdf) or access via [International Journal for Technology in Mathematics Education](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/resinf/tme/2024/00000031/00000003/art00003)

- Journal paper. Deeply technical paper (8 pages) about a specialist evaluation function for the Buckingham Pi theorem. Only recommended for specialists.
