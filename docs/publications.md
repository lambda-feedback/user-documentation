#### 2025a: Formative feedback on engineering self-study: Towards 1 million times per year per cohort

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/Johnson_etal_2025_EDUCON_camera_ready.pdf) or access via IEEE: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11016422](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11016422)

- Conference paper; 3-page summary of the Lambda Feedback system. Recommended for a general overview.

#### 2025b: Exploring the feasibility of using Generative AI to emulate teacher feedback for GCSE English Language assessments

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/Tupling_etal_2025_BERA_2025_Assessment_GenAI.pdf) or access via BERA: [https://www.bera.ac.uk/conference/bera-conference-2025/programme](https://www.bera.ac.uk/conference/bera-conference-2025/programme)

- Pilot in a school giving students automated feedback on GCSE english essays. Led by the [research team at AQA](https://www.aqa.org.uk/about-us/our-research) and presented at the [BERA 2025](https://www.bera.ac.uk/conference/bera-conference-2025/programme) conference.

#### 2025c: How do we define and evaluate "good" automated formative feedback?

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/Johnson_etal_2025_SEFI_Workshop_Good_automated_feedback.pdf). A workshop hosted at [SEFI 2025](https://www.sefi2025.eu/).

- General overview (6 pages) of the literature and thinking behind automated formative feedback, with some community inputs on how we should evaluate automated feedback. Good for educators wanting a general framing of our approach.

#### 2025d: AI microservices for sustainable innovation in education

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/AI_Microservices_for_Sustainable_Innovation_in_Education-v3.pdf) pre-print under review. Also available on OSF: [https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/wq4bd_v3](https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/wq4bd_v3)

- Journal pre-print (~30 pages). Extended manifesto on why the education sector should use microservices for automated judgement in education. Literature review, conceptual arguments on innovation and ethics, and results from deployments of Lambda Feedback. This paper is a long read, providing the detailed thinking behind Lambda Feedback.

#### 2025e: Chatbots for Dialogic Feedback during Self-Study: The Importance of Contextual Information

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/2025_EERN_Paper_Proceedings_Extracted.pdf) or access via the [Engineering Education Research Network (EERN) Conference Proceedings](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/uk-and-ireland-engineering-education-research-network-annual-symp)

- Conference Extended Abstract (8-pages). Using a framework of impasse-driven learning we explore the role of chatbots, and focus on whether the bot has access to context. Empirical results show students benefitting from chatbots accessing context. Valuable thinking behind the benefits and risks of AI in education, combining theory and practice.

#### 2024: Automated Feedback on Student Attempts to Produce a Set of Dimensionless Power Products from a Set of Physical Quantities that Describe a Physical Problem

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/Lundengard_etal_2023_Preprint_Automated_feedback_on_dimensionless_power_products_from_physical_quantities.pdf) or access via [International Journal for Technology in Mathematics Education](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/resinf/tme/2024/00000031/00000003/art00003)

- Journal paper. Deeply technical paper (8 pages) about a specialist evaluation function for the Buckingham Pi theorem. Only recommended for specialists.
