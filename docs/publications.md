#### 2025a: Formative feedback on engineering self-study: Towards 1 million times per year per cohort

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/Johnson_etal_2025_EDUCON_camera_ready.pdf) or access via IEEE: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11016422](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11016422)

- Conference paper; 3-page summary of the Lambda Feedback system. Recommended for a general overview.

#### 2025b: How do we define and evaluate "good" automated formative feedback?

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/Johnson_etal_2025_SEFI_Workshop_Good_automated_feedback.pdf). A workshop hosted at [SEFI 2025](https://www.sefi2025.eu/).

- General overview (6 pages) of the literature and thinking behind automated formative feedback, with some community inputs on how we should evaluate automated feedback. Good for educators wanting a general framing of our approach.

#### 2025c: AI microservices for sustainable innovation in education

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/AI_Microservices_for_Sustainable_Innovation_in_Education-v3.pdf) pre-print under review. Also available on OSF: [https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/wq4bd_v3](https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/wq4bd_v3)

- Extended manifesto on why the education sector should use microservices for automated judgement in education. Reviews literature on systems engineering, software architecture, and eco-systems. Articulates the role of modules, interoperability, and microservices. Focuses on arguments for innovation and ethical use of AI. Results from deployments of microservices in Lambda feedback show how such a system can work in future. Highlights the needs for the future. This paper is a long read (~30 pages), providing the detailed thinking behind Lambda Feedback.

#### 2024: Automated Feedback on Student Attempts to Produce a Set of Dimensionless Power Products from a Set of Physical Quantities that Describe a Physical Problem

- [:material-download: Download PDF](assets/publications/Lundengard_etal_2023_Preprint_Automated_feedback_on_dimensionless_power_products_from_physical_quantities.pdf) or access via [International Journal for Technology in Mathematics Education](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/resinf/tme/2024/00000031/00000003/art00003)

- Journal paper. Deeply technical paper (8 pages) about a specialist evaluation function for the Buckingham Pi theorem. Only recommended for specialists.
